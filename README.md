## About Me and Repo

I'm looking for a Ph.D. position in probability, especially in SPDEs or GFF, after completing a Bachelor's in Mathematics, a Master's in Finance and working for a while.
During my review of undergraduate courses and acquiring preparatory knowledge, I found that memorization has become more harder compared to my younger student ages.
It makes me rely on exercises much more but it's hard to seek correct and good solutions. And sometimes I even forgot the exercisesI have done before.
So I create this repo to mark and record exercises I have ever done and try to finally formed a good solutions.
I hope it could be helpful for anyone who is willing to devote in the same field.

The exercises having been done are selected totally in random during my learning progress.
Some of them having not been added into latex and pdf due to my time are pictures of drafts, which can be found at `**/images/` under each chapter directory.
Any issue about exercises in my finished chapters that need solutions is appreciated, since it will be more value than average exercises selected randomly.

The following chapters before (included) has been finished so far:

- Durrett-chapter3
- Folland-chapter2

It also will be greatly appreciated for anyone to figure out the mistakes or gaps in my solutions.


### About Chinese textbooks
中文教材主要是我大一、大二的基础课，包括
* 伍胜健-《数学分析》
* 蓝以中-《高等代数简明教程》-第二版
* 丁同仁,李承治-《常微分方程》-第二版
* 赵春来,徐明耀-《抽象代数I》

这些教材我会把一些较为潦草的解答图片放到每一章的`**/images/`，但比较确定的是不会整理成latex和pdf。因为虽然我觉得这些教材都还算不错，但用户其实还是不那么广，可能帮助到的人会相对少，我也比较难获得反馈，所以去整理的价值从各种意义上都不算大。但很欢迎任何人对这些教材的任何习题来提Issue，我会也大概率可以尽快解答。
